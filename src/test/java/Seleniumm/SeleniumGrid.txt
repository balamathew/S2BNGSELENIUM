Selenium grid
...............
Selenium grid is basically used to run the tests in remote machines ,
through command prompt we can do the setup

1.Standalone selenium driver should be installed
2.should have chromedriver.exefile and chrome installed on the remote and local machines

1.Go the folder where we have chromedriver and standalone driver and open the command prompt
2.run the jar file and set the local system as hub, this will generate a url helps the node to register with hub
3.open another cmd prompt as set the role for Node

once the role for hub and node setted up ,copy the node url
in java code ,
DesiredCapablities cap=Desiredcapablities.chrome();
cap.setbrowsername("chrome");
cap.platform(wind10);

driver=new RemoteWebdriver(new(URL(nodeurl),cap);
